# Building AIReady: The 9 Metrics That Actually Matter

> Part 3 of "The AI Code Debt Tsunami" series

---

For decades, software teams have relied on metrics like cyclomatic complexity, code coverage, and lint warnings to measure code quality. These tools were designed for human reviewers. But as AI-assisted development becomes the norm, these old metrics are no longer enough. AI models don’t “see” code the way humans do. They don’t care about your coverage percentage or how many branches your function has. What matters is how much context they can fit, how consistent your patterns are, and how much semantic duplication lurks beneath the surface.

That’s why we built **AIReady**: to measure the 9 core dimensions of AI-readiness.

## Why Traditional Metrics Fall Short

Traditional tools answer "Is this code maintainable for a human?" AIReady answers "Is this code understandable for an AI?"

An AI's "understanding" is limited by its **context window** and its ability to **predict patterns**. When your codebase is fragmented, inconsistent, or full of boilerplate, you are essentially "blinding" the AI, leading to hallucinations, broken suggestions, and subtle bugs.

## The 9 Dimensions of AI-Readiness

We've identified 9 critical metrics that determine how well an AI agent can navigate, understand, and modify your codebase.

### 1. Semantic Duplicates

**What it is:** Logic that is repeated but written in different ways.
**Why it matters:** Traditional linters miss logic duplication. AI models get confused when the same logic exists in multiple places, often updating only one and leaving the others as "logic debt."

### 2. Context Fragmentation

**What it is:** Analyzes how scattered related logic is across the codebase.
**Why it matters:** AI has a limited context window. If a single feature is spread across 15 folders, the AI cannot "see" the whole picture at once, leading to incomplete refactors.

### 3. Naming Consistency

**What it is:** Measures how consistently variables, functions, and classes are named.
**Why it matters:** AI predicts code based on patterns. Inconsistent naming (e.g., mixing `getUser` and `fetchAccount`) breaks these patterns and reduces suggestion accuracy.

### 4. Dependency Health

**What it is:** Measures the stability, security, and freshness of your dependencies.
**Why it matters:** AI models often suggest outdated or insecure packages if your project is stuck on old versions. A clean dependency graph keeps AI suggestions modern and safe.

### 5. Change Amplification

**What it is:** Tracks how many places need to change when a single requirement evolves.
**Why it matters:** AI struggles with high coupling. If one change requires 10 files to be updated, the AI is significantly more likely to miss a spot or introduce a regression.

### 6. AI Signal Clarity

**What it is:** Measures the ratio of "signal" (actual logic) to "noise" (boilerplate, dead code).
**Why it matters:** Excess boilerplate wastes the AI's context window. More "signal" means the AI can spend its tokens on the logic that actually matters.

### 7. Documentation Health

**What it is:** Checks for missing, outdated, or misleading documentation.
**Why it matters:** AI relies heavily on docstrings to understand intent. Outdated docs lead to "hallucinations" where the AI assumes behavior that no longer exists.

### 8. Agent Grounding

**What it is:** Assesses how easily an AI agent can navigate your project structure.
**Why it matters:** Standard structures allow AI agents to navigate autonomously. Confusing layouts make agents "get lost" during multi-file operations.

### 9. Testability Index

**What it is:** Quantifies how easy it is for an AI to write and run tests for your code.
**Why it matters:** AI-generated tests are the best way to verify AI-generated code. Code that is hard to test is inherently harder for an AI to maintain safely.

## How to Start Measuring

AIReady provides a unified CLI to scan your codebase against all 9 dimensions:

```bash
npx @aiready/cli scan --score
```

This command gives you an overall **AI Readiness Score (0-100)** and a detailed breakdown of where your biggest "AI Debt" lies.

## What's Next?

Over the coming weeks, we will be doing a **Deep Dive Series** into each of these 9 metrics. We'll show real-world examples of how they impact AI productivity and provide concrete refactoring strategies to improve your score.
